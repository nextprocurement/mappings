# Data sources to generate the Knowledge Graph
Since the data files are too big, the way to obtain the necessary information is by getting the original files (.parquet) from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EAdHynEgpKcTokCE0ci7-SbB4Cg2fx3f

After that, once the .ipynb file is executed, the transformations in the JSON files can be applied in order to obtain the desired data sources (.csv).

# Knowledge Graph files
Moreover, as the KGs files are also huge, they can be found here: https://delicias.dia.fi.upm.es/nextcloud/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/2021_nextProcurement/work/NextProcurement/newMorphKGC/results&fileid=9851613
